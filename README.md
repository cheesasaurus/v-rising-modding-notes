# V Rising Modding
This repo will contain notes about modding V Rising.

## Hosting a dedicated server locally

In steam library, use the filter to show **Tools** in addition to Games.
There is a tool called "V Rising Dedidcated Server" - this is what's used to run a proper server.

This video is slightly outdated but its a good starting point.

## BepInEx

Bepis Injector Extensible (BepInEx) is the magic that makes it all possible.

"BepInEx is a plugin / modding framework for Unity Mono, IL2CPP and .NET framework games (XNA, FNA, MonoGame, etc.)"

There's a preconfigured pack for V Rising: https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_V_Rising/

Follow the installation instructions at the link.

After installation, you will need to run the game once and bepinex will generate a bunch of stuff.
